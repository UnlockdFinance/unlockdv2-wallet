First run the command below to get `foundryup`, the Foundry toolchain installer:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash

If you do not want to use the redirect, feel free to manually download the
foundryup installation script from

Then, run `foundryup` in a new terminal session or after reloading your `PATH`.
